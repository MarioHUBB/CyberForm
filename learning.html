    <h2>Password Strength Checker</h2>
    <p>Our password strength checker helps you evaluate how strong your password is. We analyze:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Length of the password</li>
        <li>Mix of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols</li>
        <li>Common patterns or dictionary words that weaken passwords</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We calculate the <strong>entropy</strong> of your password, which is measured in bits. Entropy indicates how unpredictable a password is. The higher the bits, the stronger the password.</p>
    <p>Strong passwords protect you from hackers and online attacks, so itâ€™s important to use unique, complex passwords for every account.</p>

    <h2>Encryption / Decryption Tool</h2>
    <p>Our encryption tool allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt text. Encryption converts your data into a secret format that cannot be read without the correct key. Decryption reverses this process.</p>
    <p>We use strong algorithms to demonstrate encryption concepts. The key is securely stored on the server, so users cannot access or reveal it. This ensures your encrypted data is safe while using our site.</p>
    <p>Encryption is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as passwords, messages, and personal data, from unauthorized access.</p>
