    <h2>Password Strength Checker</h2>
    <p>The password strength checker helps you understand the security of your passwords. It analyzes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Length and complexity of the password</li>
        <li>Use of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols</li>
        <li>Detection of common patterns and dictionary words</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Passwords are evaluated using entropy, measured in bits. Higher entropy indicates stronger, more secure passwords that are harder for attackers to guess.</p>
    <p>The page generates strong passwords by randomly combining lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols according to your selected criteria, ensuring high entropy and resistance to guessing or brute-force attacks.</p>

    <h2>Encryption / Decryption Tool</h2>
    <p>The encryption tool allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt text. Encryption converts your data into a secure format that cannot be read without the proper key, while decryption restores it to its original form.</p>
    <p>This demonstrates important cybersecurity concepts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Symmetric key encryption</li>
        <li>Safe handling of sensitive information</li>
        <li>Client-side vs server-side encryption considerations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using this tool helps understand how data protection works in real-world applications, like securing passwords, messages, and personal data.</p>
